## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r libraries}
library(tswge)
```

## Read data

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r read data , echo=FALSE}
data = read.csv("../../data/FluNetInteractiveReport_2007_2019.csv", skip = 2)
head(data)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
